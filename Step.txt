KPI
---

The Sender simulates and processes data from sensors.
It sends data line-by-line to the console, in a format that it defines.
The Receiver inputs this data and computes statistics.

The Sender sends data to the Receiver using console redirection and pipes.
They need to run on the command-line as follows:

    sender-executable | receiver-executable

This would make the console-writes of the sender become the console-reads of the receiver. 
It gives us the flexibility of decoupling the sender and receiver - they can even be written in different languages.

Phases
------

Develop the Sender in the first phase, complete with test cases. 
The syntax and meaning of the data must be evident by reading your test cases. 

The Interface
-------------
The Sender is testable without the Receiver - so we can develop for another sensor, test and be confident about integration.

Decomposition of responsibility
-------------------------------

The naming of source files within the Sender and within the Receiver give their internal decomposition.

Minimum Functionality
---------------------

    The Sender
    ----------

    -> simulates and sends at least two Battery / Charging parameters
    -> sends fifty readings in a stream
    -> can either generate values for the parameters, or read from a file
    -> uses console output to communicate the parameters.

Quality Parameters
------------------

Setup the quality parameters of your project (duplication, complexity, coverage, warnings) using GitHub workflow yml files.

Process of Creating the script
------------------------------

1. At first I will consider three charging paramters as a input (although it can be any values)
    (Temperature, SOC, charge_rate)
    Battery Type and Temp_Type can be given as extra input, as Temp_Type can be (Celcius or Fahrenheit)
    In the test case json, we need to consider at least two battery types, so more than two can also be considered

2.
